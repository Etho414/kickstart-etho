## My NEOVIM Config

This config is nowhere near as functional as others, just wanted a place to store my current config.
Most of what was done was reorganizing the way plugins are loaded to more of my liking, also reconfigged most of the binds to go to lua/etho/custom-remaps since i like having all binds in a file instead of them being spread out

## NOTE

This config is built off of [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
